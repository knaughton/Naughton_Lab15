  <p>Schools out for the summer! It's going to be a {{retrievedWords.adjectiveOne || '____________'}} break. {{retrievedWords.person || '____________'}} and I have three trips planned. The one I am most stoked for is our trip to {{retrievedWords.place || '____________'}}. In my opinion it is the best place to visit. The city its self has so much to offer. Some of the best parts of the city are {{retrievedWords.properNounOne || '____________'}}, {{retrievedWords.properNounTwo || '____________'}}, {{retrievedWords.properNounThree || '____________'}}, and {{retrievedWords.properNounFour || '____________'}}. Each of these spots are {{retrievedWords.adjectiveTwo || '____________'}} in there own way. It is {{retrievedWords.adverbOne || '____________'}} that {{retrievedWords.person || '____________'}} and I will {{retrievedWords.verbOne || '____________'}} and {{retrievedWords.verbTwo || '____________'}} while we are there. Those are our two favoriate hobbies. {{retrievedWords.adverbTwo || '____________'}}, we have both been to {{retrievedWords.place || '____________'}} before so we will not feel rushed to see all the {{retrievedWords.adjectiveThree || '____________'}} sights. {{retrievedWords.adverbThree || '____________'}}, it's summer vacation!!!</p>

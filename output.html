  <p>Schools out for the summer! It's going to be an {{retrievedWords.adjectiveOne}} break. {{retrievedWords.person}} and I have three trips planned. The one I am most stoked for our trip to {{retrievedWords.place}}. In my opinion it is the best place to visit. The city its self has so much to offer. Some of the best parts of the city are the {{retrievedWords.properNounOne}}, {{retrievedWords.properNounTwo}}, {{retrievedWords.properNounThree}}, and {{retrievedWords.properNounFour}}. Each of these spots are {{retrievedWords.adjectiveTwo}} in there own way. It is {{retrievedWords.adverbOne}} that {{retrievedWords.person}} and I will {{retrievedWords.verbOne}} and {{retrievedWords.verbTwo}} while we are there. Those are our two favoriate hobbies. {{retrievedWords.adverbTwo}}, we have both been to {{retrievedWords.place}} before so we will not feel rushed to see all the {{retrievedWords.adjectiveThree}} sights. {{retrievedWords.adverbThree}}, it's summer vacation!!!</p>
